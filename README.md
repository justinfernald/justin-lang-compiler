# CFG parser

This is a context free grammar such that you can define grammars and then pass inputs to test to see if a input is in the grammar. This is done using the Earley algorithm.

Feature not fully implemented in handling of epsilons as it works for some scenarios.

This code can be modified to show a parse tree which I might do later.
